Image Processing with Matrices (C++ Project)
📌 Overview

This project implements a simple image processing system in C++ using only standard libraries.
It represents images as 3D matrices (height × width × channels) and provides basic operations such as grayscale conversion, flipping, brightness/contrast adjustments, blurring, and rotation.

The project works with PPM (Portable Pixmap, P3 format) images and demonstrates how common image transformations can be implemented without relying on external libraries like OpenCV.

⚙️ Features

The project supports the following image operations:

✅ Grayscale Conversion – Convert RGB to grayscale using luminance formula.

✅ Flip Horizontal – Mirror the image left-to-right.

✅ Flip Vertical – Mirror the image top-to-bottom.

✅ Adjust Brightness – Increase or decrease brightness by a given value.

✅ Adjust Contrast – Modify contrast with a scaling factor.

✅ Blur Filter – Apply a simple 3×3 average filter.

✅ Rotate 90° Clockwise – Rotate the image by 90 degrees.
